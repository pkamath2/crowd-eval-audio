          ><br />
          The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the quality of
          interfaces and articulation of the quality under test while conducting
          listening tests online via crowdsourced marketplaces such as Amazon's
          Mechanical Turk. The audio clips under test belong to the domain of
          audio textures (for e.g. a series of popping sounds, the ticking sound
          made by a Geiger counter or the sound made by water filling a
          container) or pitches made by musical instruments. The specific goal
          of this project is to ensure that the synthetic outputs generated by
          these deep learning models are validated by human beings to test for
          certain sound qualities like smoothness, naturalness or absence of
          noise etc.</span
